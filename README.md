# IoD-ButtSniffer
IoD Bluetooth Sniffer rPi solution

## Hardware: 

Raspberry Pi 3 model B - [LINK](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/)  
DS3231 Real Time Clock - [LINK](https://www.amazon.ca/Source-Hardware-Raspberry-Foreign-Precision/dp/B077LPJHXK/ref=sr_1_2)  
Asus BT400 USB Bluetooth 4.0 adapter [LINK](https://www.amazon.ca/ASUS-USB-Adapter-Bluetooth-USB-BT400/dp/B00DJ83070/ref=sr_1_1)  
8gb or larger MicroSD card for rPi  

## Software: 

- OS: Raspian Stretch Lite (Built and tested on release 2017-11-29) [Download link](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/)  
- Scanner: Kismet Wireless Scanner [Download link](https://kismetwireless.net/)  
- Kismet Plugin: IoD-Screwdriver IoD device highlighting plugin [Download link](https://github.com/internetofdongs/IoD-Screwdriver.git)  
- Kismet Plugin: Kismet Mobile Dashboard [Download link](https://github.com/elkentaro/KismetMobileDashboard)  
- BT Firmware: WinterHeart Broadcom Firmware repository [Download link](https://github.com/winterheart/broadcom-bt-firmware)  

### This uses the new Kismet Development branch which is changing daily and a moving target.  Things may break from time to time.


## Assumptions:

- rPi3 onboard Bluetooth and two BT400's all used for scanning  
- rPi3 onboard Wi-Fi used as access point for service data  
- rPi3 onboard Ethernet is set to DHCP for LAN access and data access  
- DS3231 RTC module for maintaining the clock sync for accurate logs  
- Mobile device (phone/tablet) used for accessing web interface to monitor data collection  
- System can be run easily off of USB 5v battery packs with 2.1 AMP capability. Runtime determined by capacity of battery pack  
- Unit can used for static installation as well over LAN connection as well  
- Usernames and Passwords assumed to be default but any sudo capable user should work  
- Installation assumes Internet access via LAN Ethernet connection  

## Install Instructions:

- Write Raspian image to SD card as per normal and boot the image

- Install git via apt-get (sudo apt-get install git)

- Grab the IoD-ButtSniffer scripts (git clone https://github.com/internetofdongs/IoD-ButtSniffer)

- Change into the IoD-ButtSniffer directory (cd IoD-ButtSniffer) and run the scripts:

There are 3 main scripts to run and should be run in this order:

1. setup_system.sh - Sets up the system, installs dependancies 
and configurations for various system services

2. setup_kismet.sh - Download kismet dependancies, the git 
repository and plugins.  It then builds kismet, the plugins, 
copies the config files, and sets up the data directory

3. setup_BT_FW - (Optional) - If your Bluetooth adapter is complaining in dmesg about needing a firmware:

```
Bluetooth hci1: Direct firmware load for brcm/BCM20702A1-0b05-17cb.hcd failed with error -2"
Bluetooth: hci1: BCM: Patch brcm/BCM20702A1-0b05-17cb.hcd not found"
```

Run this script to download the various firmwares for broadcom based adapters and copy the .hcd file that it is looking for (i.e. 
BCM20702A1-0b05-17cb.hcd) from the ~/broadcom-bt-firmware/brcm/ directory to /lib/firmware/brcm/, then reboot or reinsert the adapter"

## Errata

On boot, dnsmasq/dhcpd will show an error, just ignore it. I still need to figure this out. Its an issue with the interfaces file and 
dhcpcd.conf file


## TO DO

Menus and install questions to allow various configuration options  
Tons of tweaks to the Kismet config
